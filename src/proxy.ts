/**
 * "Markdown for Agents" content negotiation for the homepage: an agent that
 * sends `Accept: text/markdown` gets a markdown mirror of the page instead
 * of the HTML response. Browsers (which send `text/html,...`) are unaffected
 * — HTML stays the default.
 *
 * `Vary: Accept` is set on the markdown response (so caches don't serve it
 * for a plain HTML request). On the pass-through branch we also append it,
 * but Next's App Router sets its own `Vary` later for RSC purposes and
 * overwrites it there — a caching nicety we don't control, not a
 * correctness issue: the negotiation itself is per-request and unaffected.
 *
 * Scoped to `/` only for now (see matcher below); the same pattern can be
 * extended to other routes with per-page markdown builders later.
